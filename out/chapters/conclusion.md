Due to HAWK not being entirely stable, performance analysis is difficult in general.
However, there was a lot of insight gained into different tools to analyse HPC performance and how to use HPC resources
provided by big supercomputers.
In the end the work done so far was transferred to the supervisor and parts already shared with the developer team.
This can be taken further, as soon as HAWK stability issues are resolved.
