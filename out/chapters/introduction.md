The development of effective \gls{rl} strategies in domains with sparse rewards and high environmental complexity, remains a persistent challenge. 
SwarmRL \cite{swarmrl} addresses many of these complexities. 
However, one particularly promising yet underexplored dimension in this context is the use of interactive games as tools to collect training data for
pre-training of RL models as a form of supervised learning. 
This work explores the idea and a sample implementation of game-based human data collection into \gls{rl} training workflows.

# The Value of Human Demonstrations

\gls{rl} algorithms, while powerful, are often data-inefficient and suffer from poor generalization in the early stages of training.
Human demonstrations, particularly when embedded in game-like environments, can offer invaluable priors for \gls{rl} models.

## Intuitive heuristics
Humans bring evolved problem-solving strategies to complex physical tasks, especially those involving coordination, 
spatial reasoning, or adaptive behavior in noisy environments. 
Leveraging this knowledge and intuitive problem solving capabilities for \gls{rl} tasks looks like a promising approach.

## Efficient exploration
Unlike RL agents that rely on stochastic exploration, humans tend to focus on informative trajectories and are efficiently sampling
the state space and avoiding fruitless paths again leveraging their more advanced understanding of the environment to create policies which can then be imitated by the \gls{rl} policy.

## Multi-agent coordination
SwarmRL supports \gls{marl}, where coordination is critical. 
Human behavior in cooperative and competitive games provides rich data for shaping emergent strategies.

# Games as Natural Data Collection Interfaces

Games offer an ideal interface for crowdsourcing behavioral data in domains like microrobotics and active matter systems. 
By embedding problem-inspired tasks into interactive games, one can capture human interactions with those environments in a controlled, measurable manner.

There are many possible examples for such environments like a game which simulates microswimmer navigation in a viscous fluid, 
where players steer virtual colloids to target areas under constraints like Brownian motion and active force limitations.
Another game could present a swarm of agents that must collectively push an object or perform a chemotactic behavior, mimicking real-world tasks for SwarmRL agents.

These setups produce high-quality labeled trajectories suitable for pre-training actor and critic networks or informing reward structures via inverse \gls{rl}.
Captured sessions can be replayed and encoded as training episodes for pre-training.

# Advantages for Pre-Training

Human-inspired pre-training could yield several practical benefits:

- With initial weights guided by human priors, agents require fewer episodes to reach competent performance.
- Pre-trained models reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures in physical experiments or simulations.
- Models exposed to diverse human strategies may generalize better to novel task configurations or reward structures.

# Challenges and Future Directions

Despite its promise, integrating games as a data source for \gls{rl} model pre-training poses some challenges.
The games must balance playability with scientific fidelity, ensuring that human strategies are realistically mappable to the underlying control problem.
Human data can be noisy and suboptimal. Filtering, clustering, and weighting techniques should be applied before use in pre-training.
Defining reward functions that align human intent with \gls{rl} optimization is non-trivial, especially in complex, multi-agent settings.

Future work could explore interactive game environments co-simulated with the underlying agent environment, 
enabling real-time data feedback loops, human-in-the-loop training, and collaborative human-AI control strategies.


# Conclusion

Games are not merely entertainmentâ€”they are potent cognitive tools.
By tapping into human intuition through interactive simulations, we can bootstrap learning agents with richer priors and accelerate training. 
This synergy of human ingenuity and artificial learning offers a promising path toward realizing the full potential of complex \gls{rl} systems.
