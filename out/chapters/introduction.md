The development of effective \gls{rl} strategies in domains with sparse rewards and high environmental complexity, remains a persistent challenge. 
SwarmRL \cite{swarmrl} addresses many of these complexities. 
However, one particularly promising yet underexplored dimension in this context is the use of interactive games as tools to collect training data for
pre-training of RL models as a form of supervised learning. 
This work explores the idea and a sample implementation of game-based human data collection into \gls{rl} training workflows.

# The Value of Human Demonstrations

\gls{rl} algorithms, while powerful, are often data-inefficient and suffer from poor generalization in the early stages of training.
Human demonstrations, particularly when embedded in game-like environments, can offer invaluable priors for \gls{rl} models.

## Intuitive heuristics
Humans bring evolved problem-solving strategies to complex physical tasks, especially those involving coordination, 
spatial reasoning, or adaptive behavior in noisy environments.

## Efficient exploration
Unlike RL agents that rely on stochastic exploration, humans tend to focus on informative trajectories and are efficiently sampling
the state space and avoiding fruitless paths.

## Multi-agent coordination
SwarmRL supports \gls{marl}, where coordination is critical. 
Human behavior in cooperative and competitive games provides rich data for shaping emergent strategies.

# 3. Games as Natural Data Collection Interfaces

Games offer an ideal interface for crowdsourcing behavioral data in domains like microrobotics and active matter systems. By embedding SwarmRL-inspired tasks into interactive games, one can capture human interactions with microscale environments in a controlled, measurable manner.

For example:

* A game could simulate microswimmer navigation in a viscous fluid, where players steer virtual colloids to target areas under constraints like Brownian motion and active force limitations.
* Another game could present a swarm of agents that must collectively push an object or perform a chemotactic behavior, mimicking real-world tasks in SwarmRL simulations.

These setups produce high-quality labeled trajectories suitable for pre-training actor networks or informing reward structures via inverse reinforcement learning.

# 4. Integration with the SwarmRL Framework

SwarmRL’s modular architecture makes it particularly well-suited for incorporating game-based human data:

* **Tasks**: Human gameplay can directly correspond to existing `Task` objects in SwarmRL. Game success metrics become reward signals, while sub-task completions can be extracted as auxiliary objectives.
* **Observables**: By constraining player perception (e.g., local views, partial observability), we can emulate realistic sensor limitations in microrobotic agents, making human data more transferable.
* **Actions**: User inputs (e.g., clicks, joystick movements) are mapped to SwarmRL-compatible `Action` objects such as propulsion force or steering torque.

Captured sessions can be replayed and encoded as training episodes for pre-training using behavior cloning or offline RL.

# 5. Advantages for Pre-Training

Human-inspired pre-training in SwarmRL could yield several practical benefits:

* **Improved sample efficiency**: With initial weights guided by human priors, agents require fewer episodes to reach competent performance.
* **Safer exploration**: Pre-trained models reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures in physical experiments or simulations.
* **Task generalization**: Models exposed to diverse human strategies may generalize better to novel task configurations or reward structures.

# 6. Challenges and Future Directions

Despite its promise, integrating games as a data source in SwarmRL introduces challenges:

* **Interface design**: Games must balance playability with scientific fidelity, ensuring that human strategies are realistically mappable to the underlying microrobotic control problem.
* **Data cleaning and interpretation**: Human data is noisy and often suboptimal. Filtering, clustering, and weighting techniques must be applied before use in pre-training.
* **Reward shaping**: Defining reward functions that align human intent with RL optimization is non-trivial, especially in complex, multi-agent settings.

Future work could explore interactive game environments co-simulated with SwarmRL, enabling real-time data feedback loops, human-in-the-loop training, and collaborative human-AI control strategies.

# 7. Conclusion

Games are not merely entertainment—they are potent cognitive tools. By tapping into human intuition through interactive simulations, SwarmRL can bootstrap its learning agents with richer priors, accelerate training, and unlock novel strategies for controlling intelligent active particles. This synergy of human ingenuity and artificial learning offers a promising path toward realizing the full potential of microrobotic systems.
